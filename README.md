- 👋 Hi, I’m @guipfreiree
- 👀 I'm a curious, critical and customer empathic Software Quality Engineer, especially interested in working closely with Product and Development.
I aim to support teams to focus on CI/CD, being part and collaborating with the team from the design phase until going to production time.
Always making questions to find and anticipate risks to increase confidence for stakeholders.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
    - API Rest Testing using JUnit and RestAssured
    - End-to-end automation with Selenium WebDriver using POM and Fluent Pages
    - Mobile automation with Selenium WebDriver, Appium, Genymotion and James Proxy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on agile teams to reach higher quality standards by supporting them with testing activities
