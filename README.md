- 👋 Hi, I’m @guipfreiree
- 👀 I'm a curious, critical and customer empathic Software Quality Engineer, especially interested in working closely with Product and Development.
I aim to support teams to focus on CI/CD, being part and collaborating with the team from the design phase until going to production time.
Always making questions to find and anticipate risks to increase confidence for stakeholders.
